Homework #1 - Applied math for machine learning
This first homework has to do with reviewing some basic linear algebra concepts prevelant in machine learning techniques, as well as proving/investigating statements that involve rules/conventions in machine learning. Lastly, using a small dataset from my own research, I will use some linear algebra techniques to calculate different values.
